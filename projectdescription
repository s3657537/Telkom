<h2>Project Description</h2>
<br><br><br><br>

<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>The current state of the art of home automation section is currently held by Amazon by their Echo, followed by Google with their HomeHub. Other companies that are in the home automation section also include Wink (Hub2), Samsung (SmartThings) and Apple(HomeKit) (Turner. B, 2020). What does Echo do? Amazon Echo is powered by a voice activated program called Alexa, which features various tasks like making a phone call, listening to music, setting up an alarm. Alexa is also able to control all of the electrical appliances at home, for example, checking who's at the door through your Ring doorbell, increasing the temperature from the heater, or even reviewing Arlo’s CCTV recording using your own TV through Echo (O’Boyle B, 2020). Amazon Echo is also loaded with 802.11ac chipset as their Wi-Fi receiver and great audio quality with very far range audibility (Segan S, 2019).</p>
<p>Amazon Echo seems to have most of the features that a home automation would have, but there are various technological improvements that can be made to improvise this home automation technology. Home thermostat control is currently unavailable in home automation devices including Echo’s competitors, Echo is implemented with temperature sensors but is used for emergency purposes like smoke detectors (Kumar V, 2019). Next, The data inside the home automation device can be improved in terms of the data security, for example, the video stored by the CCTV or even the data of recent searches by the user. In addition to that, current home automation devices are still not yet able to live sync multiple devices. For example, the user wants to play the same music in his room and living room at the same time.</p>
<p>The project can be improved upon as more users take this project into their lives. There will be many different improvements like better functions, adaptability to crisis, and minor improvements with design and bugs. The project would need to have impenetrable security, as it&aposs connected to via the client&aposs Wi-Fi, which can be a gateway to their private documents, this can be improved on with security measures like a simple username and password or we can implement facial recognition and finger print identification, we can also go the extra mile and have double authentication with a phone number or email address. Better functionality could include with more capacity than turning on and off appliances. The adaptability to crisis can be developed and updated on when the circumstance occurs.</p>
<p>Currently our project relies on Raspberry Pi to create the project, other technologies that allow the access to house equipment or better home automation technology. Some ideas could include smart lights, that adjust to the natural light that radiates from windows, motion sensing lights, that could turn on the lights but also start recording for the specific area and create better security for homes, like, ability to control cameras around the house or if there&aposs a security breach it will lock all the doors and Telcom+ can be personalised for each family member and the house can detect if they&aposre an intruder or not with the application. Telcom+ could become a better and cheaper application if we used an alternative to the Raspberry Pi being the Pine A64 at the current moment and better technologies similar to the Raspberry Pi could create more profit for the company and cheaper costs for clients.</p>
<p>What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years) would be that the project could be improved upon as more users take this project into their lives. There will be many different improvements like better functions, adaptability to crisis, and minor improvements with design and bugs. The project would need to have impenetrable security, as it&aposs connected to via the client&aposs Wi-Fi, which can be a gateway to their private documents, this can be improved on with security measures like a simple username and password or we can implement facial recognition and finger print identification, we can also go the extra mile and have double authentication with a phone number or email address. Better functionality could include with more capacity than turning on and off appliances. The adaptability to crisis can be developed and updated on when the circumstance occurs.</p>
<p>Currently the technologies and other developments that make it possible for our project are Raspberry Pi to create the project, other technologies that allow the access to house equipment or better home automation technology. Some ideas could include smart lights, that adjust to the natural light that radiates from windows, motion sensing lights, that could turn on the lights but also start recording for the specific area and create better security for homes, like, ability to control cameras around the house or if there&aposs a security breach it will lock all the doors and Telcom+ can be personalised for each family member and the house can detect if they&aposre an intruder or not with the application.

<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>Potential impacts of the automated house developments are the change in everyday motions undertaken by a person in their day to day lives, examples being  linking an alarm clock to send a signal to start the coffee machine allowing a streamline path in the morning routine. However potential flaws exist as the data collected can provide a deep insight on a person&aposs everyday activities and privacy concerns may arise from that. The reliance on machines to do everything may also occur through long term usage of automation, once the system breaks or becomes unavailable due to unavoidable reasons people may struggle to return to their normal routine.</p>
<p>Things that will change with this development is the general cost of living for people relying on this technology as household appliances that are able to connect with home automation will be more expensive than those without the integration capabilities to connect with other appliances.</p>
<p>The people that will be affected by this Telkom+ will be people or workplaces who utilises a lot of technology as Telkom+ are compatible with many other smart appliances,  thus making using these appliances more convenient through the uses of Telkom+.  So mainly middle class and above will be affected and these groups of people are able to buy a lot of these appliances. The creation of Telkom+ will create new appliances and replace old appliances as more companies will innovate and meet demands of people who have Telkom+, the more people use Telkom+, the more people would like to connect it to other smart devices and make their life simple and convenient.</p> 
<p>As for jobs this may create, it could create jobs that can improve Telkom+. For example, they could improve Telkom+ with the creation of 5G to make Telkom+ run faster or have Telkom+ in different forms to have it in different situation that may be unable to do yet with the current form of Telkom+ yet.</p>

<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
<p>The way this home automation, ‘Telkom+’, will affect an individual’s daily life is that it will make their lives at home easier as it allows them to access their devices all in one place. This would benefit the individual as it can lessen the amount of effort needed when using a device, shortening the amount of time it takes to complete certain actions with the device. Due to this, the individual would be able to use their time more efficiently and productively as they have the ability to make their devices automated. Some things that would be different for the individual is that they are able to remain in one location while devices that are not near them are able to complete actions. Another thing would be that the individual would now be relying on a single app/program to do/achieve most of the actions required to run/use all of their devices.</p>
